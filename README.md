- ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!, Iâ€™m Asier Ortega Legarreta @asiort
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics, Statistics and Machine Learning, and how to combine them to solve biological problems!
- ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m currently in working Darwin Bioprospecting Excellence S.L. while I'm finishing my Master's thesis.
- ðŸ’» I am currently working on small bioinformatics tools to facilitate data analysis and processing. So far I have developed two scraping tools using Selenium:
    - A tool that allows multiple BLAST searches to be performed in parallel against the NCBI database, from a multiFASTA.
    - A tool that allows to scrape all the results generated with MiGA Online, to infer the taxonomy of our genomes.
