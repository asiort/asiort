### Hi there 👋

<!--
- 👋 Hi there!, I’m Asier Ortega Legarreta @asiort
- 👀 I’m interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics, Statistics and Machine Learning, and how to combine them to solve biological problems!
- 💼 I’m currently in working Darwin Bioprospecting Excellence S.L. while I'm finishing my Master's thesis.
- 💻 I am currently working on small bioinformatics tools to facilitate data analysis and processing. So far I have developed two scraping tools using Selenium:
    - A tool that allows multiple BLAST searches to be performed in parallel against the NCBI database, from a multiFASTA.
    - A tool that allows to scrape all the results generated with MiGA Online, to infer the taxonomy of our genomes.
